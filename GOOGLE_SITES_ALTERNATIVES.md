# Why Google Sites Won't Work & Better Alternatives

## ❌ Why Google Sites Doesn't Work

Google Sites is a **website builder** (like Wix or Squarespace), not a hosting service for custom code. It:
- ❌ Doesn't allow uploading HTML/CSS/JS files
- ❌ Doesn't support custom JavaScript functionality
- ❌ Has limited customization options
- ❌ Can't host multi-page websites with custom routing
